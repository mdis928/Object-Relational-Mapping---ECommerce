## Installiations 
The following dependencies must be installed to run the application: Insomnia, dotenv, express, mysql2, sequelize, mysql database
## Usage
In order to use this app, Once you have every installed, I needed to type out my code. This homework gave us a lot of starter code. I need to add code to the models which has our objects. The objects have the tables and fields, columns. Then you need to type out the code for the routes. Once you have all your code written, make sure to do "npm run seed" and "node server.js". If you don't get any errors, then we are connected to the db and our seed data. Go to insomnia and type in localhost port 3001 and then either, /categories, /products, /tags. If you do GET route, you should see all the products, categories, and tags... depending on what you choose. You can do POST, PUT, and Delete routes as well. Then check the mysql database, you will see any updates that you made insomnia. Please see the video tutorial for visual.
